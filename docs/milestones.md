# Katiba360 Project Milestones

This document tracks major milestones achieved in the Katiba360 backend development.

## Milestone 1: User Management System (May 11, 2025)

### Overview
Implemented a comprehensive user management and personalization system for the Katiba360 platform, integrating Google OAuth for authentication while ensuring that unnecessary password handling and token resetting functionalities are excluded.

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. Database Models
- Created SQLAlchemy models for users, preferences, languages, interests, accessibility settings, content management, reading history, achievements, notifications, and OAuth sessions
- Removed all password-related fields and models
- Set default authentication provider to Google

#### 2. Data Validation
- Implemented Pydantic schemas for all entities
- Removed password-related schemas (login, password reset, etc.)
- Created comprehensive validation for user data

#### 3. Authentication System
- Implemented Google OAuth-only authentication flow
- Created JWT token generation and validation
- Added token refresh functionality
- Implemented middleware for authentication and token refresh

#### 4. User Management Services
- **AuthService**: Handles Google OAuth authentication, token management, and user sessions
- **UserService**: Manages user profiles, preferences, languages, and accessibility settings
- **ContentService**: Handles saved content, content folders, and offline content
- **ReadingService**: Tracks reading history, progress, and streaks
- **AchievementService**: Manages user achievements and gamification
- **NotificationService**: Handles user notifications
- **OnboardingService**: Manages the user onboarding flow

#### 5. API Routes
- Created RESTful endpoints for all user management functionality
- Implemented proper error handling and response formatting
- Added comprehensive documentation for all endpoints

#### 6. Middleware
- **AuthMiddleware**: Validates JWT tokens and injects user into request
- **GoogleAuthMiddleware**: Automatically refreshes Google OAuth tokens
- **LoggingMiddleware**: Logs requests and responses

#### 7. Configuration
- Created a centralized configuration system with environment variable support
- Added comprehensive documentation for all configuration options
